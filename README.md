# fizzbuzz

The classic game fizzbuzz that now apparently is asked in many job interviews, and because soon I will have to go to one, rather go prepared.

1. run fizzbuzz.py nb_numbers to generate
2. run ml_fb.py nb_epochs to train.

To make an idea, with 3300 epochs trains with 100% accuracy all the numbers up to 100.
